===Using it===

See the man page.


===ZFS Support===

This is tricky, and not recommended unless you want to experiment. You'll need
installed SPL/ZFS libraries. You'll be using the include files from the
checkout, since by default using the SPL headers hides the real system headers.
Unfortunately, the headers I've copied into libzfs/ in the checkout quite
likely don't match yours. Have fun!

	env CFLAGS="-I`pwd`/libzfs" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure
